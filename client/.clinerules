## React Three Fiber Integration

### Component Guidelines
- Keep R3F components pure (no side effects in render)
- Use `useFrame` for animation, not `requestAnimationFrame`
- Prefer declarative over imperative Three.js calls

See [rendering_pipeline.md](./rendering_pipeline.md) for detailed render pass order.

## ECS Integration

Every game entity must:
1. Be created through factory functions in `ecs/entities/`
2. Have all required components defined in `ecs/components/`
3. Be queryable through Miniplex world

Example:
```typescript
import { createPrey } from '@/ecs/entities/createPrey';

const rabbit = createPrey(world, {
  species: 'rabbit',
  position: [0, 0, 0],
});
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Touch Controls Required
- Virtual joysticks for movement
- Tap zones for actions
- Responsive UI scaling

### Gyroscope Camera
- Smooth interpolation (lerp factor: 0.1)
- Dead zone for small movements
- Fallback to touch swipe

### Performance Testing
Test on actual devices or Chrome DevTools mobile emulation:
- iPhone 12 (mid-tier target)
- Pixel 5 (Android target)
- Throttle CPU 4x slowdown

# Rendering Pipeline Guidelines

## Render Pass Order (MANDATORY)

1. **SDF Sky/Fog** - Raymarched atmosphere
2. **Terrain/Water** - Base environment geometry
3. **GLB Actors** - Animated creatures/props
4. **SDF Effects** - Caustics, fog volumes, fur shells
5. **Post-processing** - Bloom, DoF, SSAO, color grading

## Performance Budget (Mobile Target: 60fps)

- Total draw calls: < 100
- Vertex count: < 500k per frame
- Texture memory: < 200MB
- Shader complexity: < 200 instructions per pixel

## Integration with ECS

Rendering systems query ECS world for:
- Transform components (position, rotation, scale)
- Mesh components (geometry, material refs)
- Animation components (current clip, time)

See [React Three Fiber Guidelines](../../.ruler/react_three_fiber.md) for R3F patterns.
See [Shader Guidelines](../../.ruler/shaders.md) for GLSL optimization.
