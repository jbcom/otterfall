Getting Started
Installation
Global Installation (Recommended for CLI use):

npm install -g @intellectronica/ruler
Using npx (for one-off commands):

npx @intellectronica/ruler apply
Project Initialisation
Navigate to your project's root directory
Run ruler init
This creates:
.ruler/ directory
.ruler/AGENTS.md: The primary starter Markdown file for your rules
.ruler/ruler.toml: The main configuration file for Ruler (now contains sample MCP server sections; legacy .ruler/mcp.json no longer scaffolded)
(Optional legacy fallback) If you previously used .ruler/instructions.md, it is still respected when AGENTS.md is absent. (The prior runtime warning was removed.)
Additionally, you can create a global configuration to use when no local .ruler/ directory is found:

ruler init --global
The global configuration will be created to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ruler (default: ~/.config/ruler).

Core Concepts
The .ruler/ Directory
This is your central hub for all AI agent instructions:

Primary File Order & Precedence:
A repository root AGENTS.md (outside .ruler/) if present (highest precedence, prepended)
.ruler/AGENTS.md (new default starter file)
Legacy .ruler/instructions.md (only if .ruler/AGENTS.md absent; no longer emits a deprecation warning)
Remaining discovered .md files under .ruler/ (and subdirectories) in sorted order
Rule Files (*.md): Discovered recursively from .ruler/ or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ruler and concatenated in the order above
Concatenation Marker: Each file's content is prepended with --- Source: <relative_path_to_md_file> --- for traceability
ruler.toml: Master configuration for Ruler's behavior, agent selection, and output paths
mcp.json: Shared MCP server settings
This ordering lets you keep a short, high-impact root AGENTS.md (e.g. executive project summary) while housing detailed guidance inside .ruler/.

Nested Rule Loading
Ruler now supports nested rule loading with the --nested flag, enabling context-specific instructions for different parts of your project:

project/
├── .ruler/           # Global project rules
│   ├── AGENTS.md
│   └── coding_style.md
├── src/
│   └── .ruler/       # Component-specific rules
│       └── api_guidelines.md
├── tests/
│   └── .ruler/       # Test-specific rules
│       └── testing_conventions.md
└── docs/
    └── .ruler/       # Documentation rules
        └── writing_style.md
How it works:

Discover all .ruler/ directories in the project hierarchy
Load and concatenate rules from each directory in order
Decide whether nested mode is enabled using the following precedence:
ruler apply --nested (or --no-nested) takes top priority
nested = true in ruler.toml
Default to disabled when neither option is provided
When a run is nested, downstream configs are forced to keep nested = true. If a child config attempts to disable it, Ruler keeps nested processing active and emits a warning in the logs.
Nested processing carries forward each directory's own MCP bundle and configuration settings so that generated files remain scoped to their source directories while being normalized back to the project root.
Caution

Nested mode is experimental and may change in future releases. The CLI logs this warning the first time a nested run is detected so you know the behavior may evolve.

Perfect for:

Monorepos with multiple services
Projects with distinct components (frontend/backend)
Teams needing different instructions for different areas
Complex codebases with varying standards
Best Practices for Rule Files
Granularity: Break down complex instructions into focused .md files:

coding_style.md
api_conventions.md
project_architecture.md
security_guidelines.md
Example rule file (.ruler/python_guidelines.md):

# Python Project Guidelines

## General Style

- Follow PEP 8 for all Python code
- Use type hints for all function signatures and complex variables
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types rather than generic `Exception`
- Log errors effectively with context

## Security

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Be mindful of potential injection vulnerabilities
Usage: The apply Command
Primary Command
ruler apply [options]
The apply command looks for .ruler/ in the current directory tree, reading the first match. If no such directory is found, it will look for a global configuration in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ruler.

Options
Option	Description
--project-root <path>	Project root path (default: current directory).
--agents <agent1,agent2,...>	Comma-separated agent names to target (see supported list below).
--config <path>	Custom ruler.toml path.
--mcp / --with-mcp	Enable applying MCP server configurations (default: true).
--no-mcp	Disable applying MCP server configurations.
--mcp-overwrite	Overwrite native MCP config instead of merging.
--gitignore	Enable automatic .gitignore updates (default: true).
--no-gitignore	Disable automatic .gitignore updates.
--nested	Enable nested rule loading (default: inherit from config or disabled).
--no-nested	Disable nested rule loading even if nested = true in config.
--backup	Toggle creation of .bak backup files (default: enabled).
--dry-run	Preview changes without writing files.
--local-only	Skip $XDG_CONFIG_HOME when looking for configuration.
--verbose / -v	Display detailed output during execution.
Common Examples
Apply rules to all configured agents:

ruler apply
Apply rules only to GitHub Copilot and Claude:

ruler apply --agents copilot,claude
Apply rules only to Firebase Studio:

ruler apply --agents firebase
Apply rules only to Warp:

ruler apply --agents warp
Apply rules only to Trae AI:

ruler apply --agents trae
Apply rules only to RooCode:

ruler apply --agents roo
Use a specific configuration file:

ruler apply --config ./team-configs/ruler.frontend.toml
Apply rules with verbose output:

ruler apply --verbose
Apply rules but skip MCP and .gitignore updates:

ruler apply --no-mcp --no-gitignore
Usage: The revert Command
The revert command safely undoes all changes made by ruler apply, restoring your project to its pre-ruler state. It intelligently restores files from backups (.bak files) when available, or removes generated files that didn't exist before.

Why Revert is Needed
When experimenting with different rule configurations or switching between projects, you may want to:

Clean slate: Remove all ruler-generated files to start fresh
Restore originals: Revert modified files back to their original state
Selective cleanup: Remove configurations for specific agents only
Safe experimentation: Try ruler without fear of permanent changes
Primary Command
ruler revert [options]
Options
Option	Description
--project-root <path>	Path to your project's root (default: current directory)
--agents <agent1,agent2,...>	Comma-separated list of agent names to revert (agentsmd, aider, amazonqcli, amp, augmentcode, claude, cline, codex, copilot, crush, cursor, firebase, firebender, gemini-cli, goose, jules, junie, kilocode, kiro, opencode, openhands, qwen, roo, trae, warp, windsurf, zed)
--config <path>	Path to a custom ruler.toml configuration file
--keep-backups	Keep backup files (.bak) after restoration (default: false)
--dry-run	Preview changes without actually reverting files
--verbose / -v	Display detailed output during execution
--local-only	Only search for local .ruler directories, ignore global config
Common Examples
Revert all ruler changes:

ruler revert
Preview what would be reverted (dry-run):

ruler revert --dry-run
Revert only specific agents:

ruler revert --agents claude,copilot
Revert with detailed output:

ruler revert --verbose
Keep backup files after reverting:

ruler revert --keep-backups
Configuration (ruler.toml) in Detail
Location
Defaults to .ruler/ruler.toml in the project root. Override with --config CLI option.

Configuration Precedence
CLI flags (e.g., --agents, --no-mcp, --mcp-overwrite, --no-gitignore)
Settings in ruler.toml (default_agents, specific agent settings, global sections)
Ruler's built-in defaults (all agents enabled, standard output paths, MCP enabled with 'merge')
MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Configuration
MCP provides broader context to AI models through server configurations. Ruler can manage and distribute these settings across compatible agents.

TOML Configuration (Recommended)
You can now define MCP servers directly in ruler.toml using the [mcp_servers.<name>] syntax:

# Global MCP behavior
[mcp]
enabled = true
merge_strategy = "merge"  # or "overwrite"

# Local (stdio) server
[mcp_servers.filesystem]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]

[mcp_servers.filesystem.env]
API_KEY = "your-api-key"

# Remote server
[mcp_servers.search]
url = "https://mcp.example.com"

[mcp_servers.search.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer your-token"
"X-API-Version" = "v1"
Legacy .ruler/mcp.json (Deprecated)
For backward compatibility, you can still use the JSON format; a warning is issued encouraging migration to TOML. The file is no longer created during ruler init.

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/project"
      ]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git", "--repository", "."]
    }
  }
}
Configuration Precedence
When both TOML and JSON configurations are present:

TOML servers take precedence over JSON servers with the same name
Servers are merged from both sources (unless using overwrite strategy)
Deprecation warning is shown encouraging migration to TOML (warning shown once per run)
Server Types
Local/stdio servers require a command field:

[mcp_servers.local_server]
command = "node"
args = ["server.js"]

[mcp_servers.local_server.env]
DEBUG = "1"
Remote servers require a url field (headers optional; bearer Authorization token auto-extracted for OpenHands when possible):

[mcp_servers.remote_server]
url = "https://api.example.com"

[mcp_servers.remote_server.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer token"
Ruler uses this configuration with the merge (default) or overwrite strategy, controlled by ruler.toml or CLI flags.

Home Directory Safety: Ruler never writes MCP configuration files outside your project root. Any historical references to user home directories (e.g. ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json or ~/.zed/settings.json) have been removed; only project-local paths are targeted.

Note for OpenAI Codex CLI: To apply the local Codex CLI MCP configuration, set the CODEX_HOME environment variable to your project’s .codex directory:

export CODEX_HOME="$(pwd)/.codex"
Skills Support (Experimental)
⚠️ Experimental Feature: Skills support is currently experimental and requires uv (the Python package manager) to be installed on your system for MCP-based agent integration.

Ruler can manage and propagate Claude Code-compatible skills to supported AI agents. Skills are stored in .ruler/skills/ and are automatically distributed to compatible agents when you run ruler apply.

How It Works
Skills are specialized knowledge packages that extend AI agent capabilities with domain-specific expertise, workflows, or tool integrations. Ruler discovers skills in your .ruler/skills/ directory and propagates them to compatible agents:

Claude Code agents: Skills are copied to .claude/skills/ in their native format
Other MCP-compatible agents: Skills are copied to .skillz/ and a Skillz MCP server is automatically configured via uvx
Skills Directory Structure
Skills can be organized flat or nested:

.ruler/skills/
├── my-skill/
│   ├── SKILL.md           # Required: skill instructions/knowledge
│   ├── helper.py          # Optional: additional resources (scripts)
│   └── reference.md       # Optional: additional resources (docs)
└── another-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
Each skill must contain:

SKILL.md - Primary skill file with instructions or knowledge base
Skills can optionally include additional resources like:

Markdown files with supplementary documentation
Python, JavaScript, or other scripts
Configuration files or data
Configuration
Skills support is enabled by default but can be controlled via:

CLI flags:

# Enable skills (default)
ruler apply --skills

# Disable skills
ruler apply --no-skills
Configuration in ruler.toml:

[skills]
enabled = true  # or false to disable
Skillz MCP Server
For agents that support MCP but don't have native skills support (all agents except Claude Code), Ruler automatically:

Copies skills to .skillz/ directory
Configures a Skillz MCP server in the agent's configuration
Uses uvx to launch the server with the absolute path to .skillz
Example auto-generated MCP server configuration:

[mcp_servers.skillz]
command = "uvx"
args = ["skillz@latest", "/absolute/path/to/project/.skillz"]
.gitignore Integration
When skills support is enabled and gitignore integration is active, Ruler automatically adds:

.claude/skills/ (for Claude Code agents)
.skillz/ (for MCP-based agents)
to your .gitignore file within the managed Ruler block.

Requirements
For Claude Code: No additional requirements
For MCP agents: uv must be installed and available in your PATH
# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
Validation
Ruler validates discovered skills and issues warnings for:

Missing required file (SKILL.md)
Invalid directory structures (directories without SKILL.md and no sub-skills)
Warnings don't prevent propagation but help identify potential issues.

Dry-Run Mode
Test skills propagation without making changes:

ruler apply --dry-run
This shows which skills would be copied and which MCP servers would be configured.

Example Workflow
# 1. Add a skill to your project
mkdir -p .ruler/skills/my-skill
cat > .ruler/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
# My Custom Skill

This skill provides specialized knowledge for...

## Usage

When working on this project, always follow these guidelines:
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write tests for all features
- Follow the existing code style
EOF

# 2. Apply to all agents (skills enabled by default)
ruler apply

# 3. Skills are now available to compatible agents:
#    - Claude Code: .claude/skills/my-skill/
#    - Other MCP agents: .skillz/my-skill/ + Skillz MCP server configured
.gitignore Integration
Ruler automatically manages your .gitignore file to keep generated agent configuration files out of version control.

How it Works
Creates or updates .gitignore in your project root
Adds paths to a managed block marked with # START Ruler Generated Files and # END Ruler Generated Files
Preserves existing content outside this block
Sorts paths alphabetically and uses relative POSIX-style paths
Example .gitignore Section (sample - actual list depends on enabled agents)
# Your existing rules
node_modules/
*.log

# START Ruler Generated Files
.aider.conf.yml
.clinerules
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
# END Ruler Generated Files

dist/
Control Options
CLI flags: --gitignore or --no-gitignore
Configuration: [gitignore].enabled in ruler.toml
Default: enabled
Practical Usage Scenarios
Scenario 1: Getting Started Quickly
# Initialize Ruler in your project
cd your-project
ruler init

# Edit the generated files
# - Add your coding guidelines to .ruler/AGENTS.md (or keep adding additional .md files)
# - Customize .ruler/ruler.toml if needed

# Apply rules to all AI agents
ruler apply
Scenario 2: Complex Projects with Nested Rules
For large projects with multiple components or services, enable nested rule loading so each directory keeps its own rules and MCP bundle:

# Set up nested .ruler directories
mkdir -p src/.ruler tests/.ruler docs/.ruler

# Add component-specific instructions
echo "# API Design Guidelines" > src/.ruler/api_rules.md
echo "# Testing Best Practices" > tests/.ruler/test_rules.md
echo "# Documentation Standards" > docs/.ruler/docs_rules.md
# .ruler/ruler.toml
nested = true
# The CLI inherits nested mode from ruler.toml
ruler apply --verbose

# Override from the CLI at any time
ruler apply --no-nested
This creates context-specific instructions for different parts of your project while maintaining global rules in the root .ruler/ directory. Nested runs automatically keep every nested config enabled even if a child tries to disable it.

Note

The CLI prints "Nested mode is experimental and may change in future releases." the first time nested processing runs. Expect refinements in future versions.

Scenario 3: Team Standardization
Create .ruler/coding_standards.md, .ruler/api_usage.md
Commit the .ruler directory to your repository
Team members pull changes and run ruler apply to update their local AI agent configurations
Scenario 4: Project-Specific Context for AI
Detail your project's architecture in .ruler/project_overview.md
Describe primary data structures in .ruler/data_models.md
Run ruler apply to help AI tools provide more relevant suggestions

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Cannot find module" errors:

Ensure Ruler is installed globally: npm install -g @intellectronica/ruler
Or use npx @intellectronica/ruler
Permission denied errors:

On Unix systems, you may need sudo for global installation
Agent files not updating:

Check if the agent is enabled in ruler.toml
Verify agent isn't excluded by --agents flag

FAQ
Q: Can I use different rules for different agents? A: Currently, all agents receive the same concatenated rules. For agent-specific instructions, include sections in your rule files like "## GitHub Copilot Specific" or "## Aider Configuration".

Q: How do I set up different instructions for different parts of my project? A: Enable nested mode either by setting nested = true in ruler.toml or by passing ruler apply --nested. The CLI inherits the config setting by default, but --no-nested always wins if you need to opt out for a run. Nested mode keeps loading rules (and MCP settings) from every .ruler/ directory in the hierarchy, forces child configs to remain nested, and logs "Nested mode is experimental and may change in future releases." if any nested processing occurs.

Q: How do I temporarily disable Ruler for an agent? A: Set enabled = false in ruler.toml under [agents.agentname], or use --agents flag to specify only the agents you want.

Q: What happens to my existing agent configuration files? A: Ruler creates backups with .bak extension before overwriting any existing files.

Q: Can I run Ruler in CI/CD pipelines? A: Yes! Use ruler apply --no-gitignore in CI to avoid modifying .gitignore. See the GitHub Actions example above.

Q: How do I migrate from older versions using instructions.md? A: Simply rename .ruler/instructions.md to .ruler/AGENTS.md (recommended). If you keep the legacy file and omit AGENTS.md, Ruler will still use it (without emitting the old deprecation warning). Having both causes AGENTS.md to take precedence; the legacy file is still concatenated afterward.

Q: How does OpenHands MCP propagation classify servers? A: Local stdio servers become stdio_servers. Remote URLs containing /sse are classified as sse_servers; others become shttp_servers. Bearer tokens in an Authorization header are extracted into api_key where possible.

Q: Where is Zed configuration written now? A: Ruler writes a settings.json in the project root (not the user home dir) and transforms MCP server definitions to Zed's context_servers format including source: "custom".

Q: What changed about MCP initialization? A: ruler init now only adds example MCP server sections to ruler.toml instead of creating .ruler/mcp.json. The JSON file is still consumed if present, but TOML servers win on name conflicts.

Q: Is Kiro supported? A: Yes. Kiro receives concatenated rules at .kiro/steering/ruler_kiro_instructions.md.
