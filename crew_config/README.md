# CrewAI Development Setup

## Usage

```bash
# Run full crew
uv run python python/crew_agents

# Or via process-compose
process-compose up
```

## Architecture

**CrewBase Native DSL** - All configuration in `python/crew_agents/crewbase.yaml`:
- 10 specialized agents (Technical Director as hierarchical manager)
- Alpha→Work→Omega workflow pattern
- Native MCP integration (no custom adapters)
- Role-based tool filtering using `mcp://server/tool` syntax

## Configuration

- `python/crew_agents/crewbase.yaml` - **Single source of truth**
- `.mcp.json` (root) - MCP servers (generated by `ruler apply --nested`)

Legacy YAML files (`crew_config/*.yaml`) are kept for reference but no longer used by the crew.

## Environment

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-..."
export MESHY_API_KEY="msy_..."
```
