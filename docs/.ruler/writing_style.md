# Documentation Writing Standards

## Structure

- Start with **Overview** section
- Use **## Heading** for major sections
- Use **### Subheading** for subsections
- Include **Next Steps** or **References** at end

## Code Examples

Always include:
- Language identifier in fenced code blocks
- Context comments explaining non-obvious patterns
- Both "Bad" and "Good" examples for anti-patterns

## Cross-References

Use relative paths for internal links:
```markdown
See [ECS Patterns](../.ruler/ecs_patterns.md) for details.
```

## Clarity

- Write in present tense
- Use active voice
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Define acronyms on first use
