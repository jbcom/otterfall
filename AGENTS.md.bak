# Rivermarsh - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Identity
Cozy 3D otter adventure game blending exploration, fishing, questing, and relationship building. Think "Zelda: Breath of the Wild meets Stardew Valley" in a realistic marshland setting. Web + mobile (iOS/Android) targeting 60 FPS on mid-tier phones.

## Communication Style
- Speak like a normal human, not a corporate robot
- Short sentences when possible
- No fake enthusiasm
- Call things what they are
- Prefer working, beautiful code over "correct" architecture

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React Three Fiber + TypeScript + Miniplex ECS
- **Backend**: Express + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL
- **AI Systems**: Yuka.js for creature behaviors
- **Asset Pipeline**: Meshy API for 3D generation
- **Orchestration**: CrewAI agents for parallel development

## Critical Constraints
- **Performance**: 60 FPS on mid-tier mobile (< 100 draw calls, < 500k verts/frame)
- **Type Safety**: Zero TypeScript LSP errors allowed
- **Mobile First**: Touch controls, gyroscope camera, responsive UI

## Detailed Instructions
See `.ruler/` directory for component-specific rules:
- **Client rendering**: `client/.ruler/rendering_pipeline.md`
- **Python testing**: `python/.ruler/testing_conventions.md`
- **CrewAI workflows**: `python/crew_agents/.ruler/workflow_configuration.md`
- **Documentation**: `docs/.ruler/writing_style.md`

For cross-cutting concerns (ECS patterns, shaders, React Three Fiber), see `.ruler/*.md`.
